			<h2>Cross Platform Demo App<br>
			<span class="secondline">Electronic Arts</span>

			<p>
				During my internship at EA during the summer of 2013, I (along with a co-intern, <a id="jerry" href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jerry-chen/64/b38/2a8">Jerry Chen</a>) produced a cross-platform game that replicated Atari Breakout in C++ using Cocos-2DX. Through the integration of EA's new internal SDK, the app had further capabilities such as micro-transactions, push notifications, Facebook, and tracking. The app was released as part of the SDK package to game teams to assist in the integration of the SDK.

			<span class="secondline">In Progress</span>

			<p>
				This iOS app will remind you that there is street cleaning on bookmarked streets as well as streets within a certain radius from your phone's geolocation. The inspiration for the app would be the absurdly high number of parking tickets I've received since having my car in Berkeley.

					<td class="int_table"><p>Figure Skating has always been the dearest thing in my heart. I began my skating career at the age of 4, forgoing a "normal" childhood to pursue my dreams of an Olympic Gold Medal. A few of my achievements include placing 5th at the 2008 US Figure Skating National Championships in St. Paul, Minnesota, being placed on the 2014 Olympics Development Team; winning two gold medals at ISI Worlds (2010); placing 9th at the 2009 Pacific Coast Sectionals in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; winning the silver at the US National Showcase Parade of Champions (2007); and winning the Tai Babilonia Perpetual Award (), Jennifer Ritter Perpetual Award, and the Joanne Funakoshi Perpetual Award () at the LAFSC Showcase for Skaters.</p>

					<td class="int_table"> <p>Unfortunately, after sustaining just too many injuries (5 broken legs, a shattered foot, chronic tendonitis, chronic bursitis, juvenile arthritis), I realized my body just could not handle the sport any longer. So with a heavy heart, I hung up my skates for good at age 17. I'd be lying if I said that there isn't a day that I don't miss being on the ice; but I also don't regret taking steps in ensuring a long, healthy future for myself. I am glad to have come as close to my Olympic dream as I did. And I will be forever in debt to those who invested in me and often times believed in me more than I did myself (my parents, my brother Wind, and the two best coaches in the entire world, Tiffany Chin and Alex Chang).</p> </td>

					<td class="int_table"><p>My parents put me into acting at age 4 because I was such a dramatic child and because I was just too gosh-darn-cute. It was never something that I took too seriously; I just thought it was fun. And I absolutely <em>loved</em> that I was good at it. I starred in a number of commercials including Kraft Cheese American Singles, Barbie, Toys for Tots, Disneyland, Scott Paper Towels, and Long John Silvers. I even appeared in an episode of The Amanda Show. I had to quit because balancing school, acting auditions, and skating practices proved to be a little too much for me and my family. To this day, I still enjoy casually acting; I am a declared Theater and Performance Studies minor at UC Berkeley.</p></td>

					<td><p>Last Game Played: The Last of Us on Playstation 3.<br>
					Damn, that was a good storyline. Like seriously, the plot was so well-written and well-developed that my dad had to ask me twice if I was actually playing a game or watching a movie. And it wasn't just the numerous cut scenes that made it this way. The cut scenes weren't just there to tie together monotonous game play; I felt like the game play was actually requiring me to "act out" certain scenes in the "movie." To be honest, I think the plot and character development was much better than some of the movies in theaters these days. The game itself was fun but simple: you often followed cues on screen, and you always knew when the bad guys were coming. I highly recommend this game to anyone.

					<td class="int_table"><p>Last Book Read: <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> by John Green was a refreshingly short and easy read coming off of finishing the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series. With all the hype over the upcoming release of the movie based on the book, I immediately downloaded it onto my Kindle. I was definitely hesitant at first; I didn't want to read "another cancer book," because how my mom puts it, "The main character always dies." I was relieved to know that this book wasn't really about a girl's struggle with cancer; it wasn't written to make you sad for the sake of being sad or want to cry for the sake of crying (although, I must admit, I teared up a little bit). It serves to remind readers that cancer patients are not defined by their cancer; they are just as human as the rest of us. The book is about young love and chasing after what you want; and it reminds us that a short life can also be a full one.

						<td class="int_table"><p>Even though it is only in Beta right now, it's already quickly getting fans. Blizzard has made yet another successfully addictive game. Hearthstone definitely makes me a bit nostalgic of the times when I'd stay up all night strategically spamming 'Greater Heal' and 'Circle of Healing' on 40-man raids in WoW. But my favorite thing about Hearthstone is that it isn't terribly time-consuming. That is, a game usually takes about 10 minutes. So I can easily play a game or two in the middle of the day without hesitation. Good job, Blizzard. I'm excited to see how the game progresses as it moves along in its production stage and is finally publically released.</p></td>
